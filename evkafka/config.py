    acks: Any
    """
    One of ``0``, ``1``, ``all``. The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader
    to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records
    that are sent. The following settings are common:

        * ``0``: Producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server
          at all. The message will immediately be added to the socket
          buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the
          server has received the record in this case, and the retries
          configuration will not take effect (as the client won't
          generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each
          record will always be set to -1.
        * ``1``: The broker leader will write the record to its local log but
          will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all
          followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately
          after acknowledging the record but before the followers have
          replicated it then the record will be lost.
        * ``all``: The broker leader will wait for the full set of in-sync
          replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the
          record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
          remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.

    If unset, defaults to ``acks=1``. If `enable_idempotence` is `True` defaults to ``acks=all``.
    """

    compression_type: str
    """
    The compression type for all data generated by the producer. Valid values are ``gzip``,
    ``snappy``, ``lz4``, ``zstd`` or `None`. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy
    of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).
    Default: `None`.
    """

    max_batch_size: int
    """
    Maximum size of buffered data per partition. After this amount `send` coroutine will block until
    batch is drained. Default: 16384.
    """

    linger_ms: int
    """
    The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into
    a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than
    they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of
    requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of
    artificial delay; that is, if first request is processed faster, than `linger_ms`, producer will wait
    ``linger_ms - process_time``. Default: 0 (i.e. no delay).
    """

    partitioner: Callable
    """
    Callable used to determine which partition each message is assigned to. Called (after key
    serialization): ``partitioner(key_bytes, all_partitions, available_partitions)``. The default
    partitioner implementation hashes each non-None key using the same murmur2 algorithm as the Java
    client so that messages with the same key are assigned to the same partition. When a key is
    `None`, the message is delivered to a random partition (filtered to partitions with available
    leaders only, if possible).
    """

    max_request_size: int
    """
    The maximum size of a request. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note
    that the server has its own cap on record size which may be different from this. This setting
    will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid
    sending huge requests. Default: 1048576.
    """

    enable_idempotence: bool
    """
    When set to `True`, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written
    in the stream. If `False`, producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates
    of the retried message in the stream. Note that enabling idempotence acks to set to ``all``.
    If it is not explicitly set by the user it will be chosen. If incompatible values are set,
    a :exc:`ValueError` will be thrown.
